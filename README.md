# Viano
Viano is a minimal engine for the easy creation of videos designed for number keys, like pianos. Just put a video file called video.mp4 in the same folder as index.html.

Originally developed by [childishbeat](https://github.com/childishbeat/Viano), this fork implements keys J and L to skip by 10 seconds backward and forward respectively, as well as K to play/pause.

The included example is [FOUR SPELLS THE ALPHABET](https://youtu.be/GIspXB_-2AE), a BFDI soundboard video by [Cary Huang](https://www.youtube.com/@â€‹Humany).
