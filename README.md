# Viano
Viano is a minimal engine for the easy creation of videos designed for number keys, like pianos. Just put a video file called video.mp4 in the same folder as index.html. The included example is [Interactive Youtube Piano](https://youtu.be/eQ-eE8Ai_8g) by [Seth Sandler](https://www.youtube.com/user/cerupcat).
